### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Manflo27/Manflo27** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on testing, debugging, and reading documentation for the LEARN Application.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning oftware development practices such as Agile methodology and version control systems like Git.

                      #181717 github.com/Manflo27
                     


- âš¡ Fun fact: The NFl has a team of developers who work on building and maintaining their digital platforms and apps? These developers use a variety of technologies, including React, Ruby on Rails, and Java. In fact, the NFL has a public API that developers can use to build their own applications using NFL data.
